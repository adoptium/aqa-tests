# Values required for Java_net and Java_security tests : Currently these are dummy non-working values.
# Before running the JCK tests which need these settings:
# 1. This file must be copied into a directory alongside the JCK installation - e.g.
# /jck/jck8b/config/<config-name>/jcktest.properties
# 2. An https and Kerberos server must be set up
# 3. The values in the copied file must be updated to reflect the server set up.
# The tests default to using 'default' as the config name.  If another name is used it must be
# supplied to the test at run time - see openjdk.test.jck/docs/README.md for more details.
