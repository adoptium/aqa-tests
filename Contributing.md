## Submitting a contribution to AQAvit

After signing ECA, you can propose contributions by sending pull requests (PRs) through GitHub.

1. If this is your first time contributing to the project, fork the repo by clicking on the `Fork` button in the top-right corner of the git repo page.
This creates a copy of the repo under your GitHub account: `https://github.com/<YourGitUserName>/aqa-tests.git`

2. Git clone the your aqa-tests repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/<YourGitUserName>/aqa-tests.git
```

3. Create a new branch to work on:
```
cd aqa-tests
git checkout -b my_new_branch
```

4. Add https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests.git as your upstream:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests.git
```

5. Before you start working on the issue, plese make sure the local branch is up to date:
```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```
or 
```
git reset --hard upstream/master
```

6. Once you are done with your work, track your changes and commit. 
```
git add .
git commit -s -m "message about this PR"
```

Commit message example:

```

This patch updates jtreg version from 5.1 to 6.1.

```

- The first line is the PR title. It should describe the change made. Please keep it short and simple.
- The body should include detailed information about your PR. You may want to include designs, rationale, and a brief explanation of what you have changed. Please keep it concise.
- When a commit has related issues, please use the Git keywords to automatically close or relate to the issues.
https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/
- Please sign off on your commit in the footer. This can be automatically added to your commit by passing `-s` to `git commit` (see above example).

7. Push the change into your Git repo:
```
git push -f origin my_new_branch
```

You can skip `-f` in `git push` if you've never pushed your branch before.

8. We would like to encourage you to open a pull request early and use `Create draft pull request` option. This allows others to check the PR, get early feedback, and helps create a better end product.

9. If you have been given access to run test jobs in our Jenkins server, run [Grinder](https://ci.adoptium.net/job/Grinder/) to validate your PR. Your can find recordings about how to use Grinder in AQA Lightning Talk Series: https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/wiki/AQA-Lightning-Talk-Series.  If you do not have access, the reviewers of your PR will run some tests.  Reviewers may ask you to run extra tests depending on what changes you have made in your PR.

10. Ensure all related Grinder jobs pass and provide the Grinder links in the PR comment. Your changes must also pass the auto PR builds that will be applied to your pull request.

11. Convert PR to `Ready for review` once the PR is ready.


## Code Review Process Guideline

To ensure high code quality, maintainability, and collaboration, all code changes should go through a structured review process before being merged into the main branch.

1. Assigning Reviewers
- Assign at least one project committer as the reviewer.
- Choose a reviewer with relevant knowledge of the codebase or feature.
2. Reviewer Responsibilities
- Review the code for:
   - Correctness and functionality
   - Code style and readability
   - Test coverage and reliability
   - Code maintainability and performance
- Approve the PR once it meets quality standards.
3. Merging the PR
- Only the assigned reviewer should merge the PR after approval.
- The author should not merge their own PR unless explicitly allowed under specific circumstances (e.g. hotfixes with prior approval).


## Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Usage Guidelines

To ensure transparency, maintain the quality and integrity of our codebase, we have the following expectations regarding the use of generative AI tools in contributions:

#### For Contributors

If generative AI is used to assist with any part of a Pull Request, please disclose this by adding a comment directly below the copyright header in each affected file:

```
// Some portions generated by Co-Pilot

```

The contributors are responsible for reviewing and validating any AI-generated content before submission. Do not rely on AI output without understanding and verifying it.

#### For Committers / Reviewers

The committers/reviewers should check that contributors who used AI tools have disclosed it properly in affected files.
The committers/reviewers should review AI-generated content with extra care. Ensure that generated content meets the project's standards for correctness, performance, readability, and security.

Please also refer to [Generative Artificial Intelligence Usage Guidelines for Eclipse Committers](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/guidelines/genai/) for details.
